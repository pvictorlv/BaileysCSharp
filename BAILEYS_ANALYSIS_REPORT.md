- Type-safe event handlers
- Event buffering and batching
- Comprehensive error handling

**BaileysCSharp**:
- Basic event framework with 12 event stores
- Type-safe handlers
- Basic buffering support
- Limited error handling

**Missing Event Types**:
- `messaging-history.set` - History sync events
- `lid-mapping.update` - LID mapping updates
